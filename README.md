# AirBnb-Booking-Analysis

This exploratory data analysis Project is prepared and successfully executed by using google colab platform.

All the problem areas,solutions , visual represtation depicted here are implemented using python programming language and its various modules like numpy, pandas, datetime, matplotlib etc.

You can access the sheet and load data set (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioU5r9KEYSfwgfUi22SclVkx4l1a_8ou/view?usp=sharing) into your drive and either mount your drive with google colab or upload the file directly into google colab for accessing all the analysis made properly.

EDA is divided into following 3 analysis:

Univariate analysis: Univariate analysis is the simplest of the three analyses where the data, you are analyzing is only one variable.

Bivariate analysis: Bivariate analysis is where you are comparing two variables to study their relationships.

Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing more than two variables.


This project majorly deals with Airbnb platform which connects people who want to rent out their homes or spare/extra room or space with people who are looking for accommodations in different locations.

Airbnb offers people an easy and stress-free way to earn some income from their existing property round the globe.

It has been observed that travellers often find Airbnb cheaper, has more character, and is homier than hotels or guest houses.

Airbnb makes the bulk of its revenue by charging a rental fee for each booking.

Their are millions of listing present on airBnb Platform and hence generate a lot of data.


Data is an important factor and crucial factor for the company since it can be used for purposes like business decisions , guiding marketing initiatives ,understanding the behavioural pattern of customers and hosts and implementation of addittion services.


In this project ,we'll be first focusing on data cleaning / regenrating to make data analysis ready and then coming up with unique insights about different aspects of data and visualizing it by adopting different techniques from python libraries and drawing conclusions at last.


The data majorly deals with solving numerous issues faced by both host and guests through out the process of booking/renting which can be curbed down by providing the exact same information needed by guests or hosts while booking such as location , area , facilities , fair price comparison , proper reviews and most relevent analysis which makes it easy for them to make the most relevent selection/choice.



Our business objective includes performing the right set of analysis in order to provide the relevent and sufficient information which can proved to be helpful while taking any sort of business decision or running any kind of marketing initiative which ultimately should be focussed towards success of business.


After proper analysis , we can suggest them to keep following things in mind:-

Since Manhattan area itself covers 44.30% of the maximum properties plus it consists most of the highly priced listings which utlimately makes it an tourist spot since it is prefered by most of the guests, also since minimum nights to be booked are high for this area.

but we should focus more on making properties available for longer duration at such main attraction including brooklyn too and encourage people to review the property more(by providing rebooking points in return to that )since review rates are low.

We should encourage host to list more "Entire home/apt" room type since it is preffered 51.97% more by the visitors , also prices are ultimately high so it'll help to generate more revenue.

Properties in areas like areas staten island and bronx are more reviwed by guests since but listing are less over here, which means it can turn out profitable for business if we focus to gather more hosts from these areas to list their properties.

From the hosts perspective, we can suggest them to rent their properties more in tourist prone areas by helping them with analysis report which in turn will improve their profit share and business can flourish too.

We generated a lot of conclusions , some of them are as follows :

Out of the three types of room types i.e. private room (45.66 % presence rate) ,shared room (2.37% presence rate)and entire home/apartment(51.97% presence rate),the entire home/apartment tends for more costlier , where as shared rooms being lowest priced.

While analysing the trend of rates of properties across years , we came across in sudden hike in the prices of the properties which were lastly reviewed in the year 2013.

As AirBnb Started in the 2007 ,however from analysis we may reach to the conclusion to that hosts started trusting the process more from the year 2015 and as the time progresses finally in the year 2019 we could a sudden spike or rise in the listings of property in terms of reviews they got.

From dataset we got to know that their are many host who own more then one property as well ranging from 0-300 , however people owning properties between count of 0-50 have some of their property priced exceptionally high which might lead them to earn better revenue as compared to host having higher listings with less/decent prices , if opted by the guest.

The Manhattan (44.30% listings/properties ) area has most of the highly priced listings where as bronx being the lowest which makes manhattan an tourist spot prefered by most of the guests since minimum nights rates are also high for this area.

Though staten island has more availability scenes across the years and brooklyn(41.12% listings) being the lowest, reason might be host at staten island have more properties to rent for longer duration but it might not be tourist attraction. however we should focus more on making properties available for longer duration at main attraction such as manhattan and brooklyn too.

Properties located in areas staten island(0.76% listings)and bronx(2.23% listings ) are reviewed more by guests as compared to others i.e. they are trying to improve.

Though we witnessed that areas like brooklyn and Queens are less preffered by guests , however they too some exceptionally high properties ,which can be suggested to the custoner having higher paying capability.

Generally customer prefer a property lying between decent price range of 0-2000 dollars , since number of reviews are high for such properties however their are customer who dosent hesitate to invest or pay higher prices as well but they fall under minority.

From correlation heatmap , we could infer that generally people who choose to stay for a very longer period of time are likely(0.17%) to provide their reviews for that property.
