## Introduction
The "AirBnB Booking Analysis" project focuses on exploring and analyzing the booking data of AirBnB rentals to gain valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and factors influencing the booking process.

Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who offer unique lodging options around the world.

By conducting an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this data, our goal is to understand the preferences of travelers and hosts, identify peak booking seasons, and discover interesting correlations between various attributes and booking trends.

As the travel industry rapidly evolves, data-driven decision-making is becoming increasingly vital for both hosts and travelers.

This project aims to provide actionable insights to AirBnB hosts, enabling them to optimize their listings, improve customer experiences, and maximize occupancy rates. Simultaneously, it empowers travelers to make informed choices when selecting AirBnB accommodations that best align with their preferences and requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ioU5r9KEYSfwgfUi22SclVkx4l1a_8ou/view?usp=sharing). It comprises a comprehensive collection of information related to Airbnb bookings, including:

room_type:- type of property [private, shared,entire]

price:- rent of the property

minimum_nights:- min nights to be paid for

number_of_reviews:- total reviews made

last_review:- date of the last review

reviews_per_month:- average reviews

calculated_host_listings_count:- total property per host

availability_365:- available days around the year

Depending on the dataset source, additional relevant features may also be included to enhance the analysis.

- `airbnb_booking_analysis.ipynb`: Colab Notebook containing the step-by-step EDA process and data visualization.


Feel free to modify the code according to your needs and experiment with different visualizations and analysis techniques.

## Data Exploration

In the Colab Notebook, we perform a comprehensive data exploration to gain insights into various aspects of AirBnB bookings.

This includes understanding the distribution of different features, visualizing trends over time, analyzing price variations across listings, exploring the most popular neighborhoods, and identifying patterns in booking behavior.

## Findings

The results of the data exploration and analysis are presented in the Colab Notebook.

Some of the key findings and insights obtained from the EDA may include:

- Seasonal booking patterns: Identifying periods of high and low booking activity.
  
- Impact of room type on pricing: Understanding how different room types influence listing prices.
  
- Correlations between reviews, ratings, and pricing: Examining relationships between guest feedback, ratings, and listing prices.
  
- Most sought-after neighborhoods: Discovering neighborhoods that attract the highest number of bookings.
  
- Peak booking periods: Identifying specific times of the year when booking demand is at its peak.

These insights can be used by AirBnB hosts to optimize their listings, set competitive pricing, and provide exceptional guest experiences. Additionally, travelers can benefit from these findings to plan their trips more effectively and select the most suitable accommodations.
